        <p id="how i learned to code">I learned to code on Khan Academy when I was 10. I learned JavaScript, which was a bit difficult for thst age, but I learned the basics. For some time, I gave up and I didn't code for much time, but after that period, I began to learn HTML, which I think that is a lot easier than JS. Now, I know how to code a website and I am looking forward to learn how to post one on the web.</p>

        <p id="paragraph2">I firstly learned about Khan Academy when my father told me about it, because I told him that I want to learn how to code. I think that Khan Academy is a great place for learning new content, because it has a lot of topics. For example, when I didn't knew how to solve my math homework, and boom, the result of the search helped me solve my problem. Also, the thing that is free, I think that this is amazing because Khan Academy has an extraordinary amount of content which is free. For the future, after I finish with HTML and CSS, I want to learn SQL and to learn moren JS.</p>
